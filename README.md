####Notes
* Storage is incomplete (ran out of time), tests (besides autocannon), much the same.
* Performance is already bad with ~300 LOC, SOLID/OCP/etc are absolutely nonexistent.
* Please treat this as more of a question prompt then an actual measure of my work :)
####Run instructions
* Set desired port in /config/server.json
* Use node 12.5+ (static properties won't work without it)
* Npm install && Npm start
* Postman away!
